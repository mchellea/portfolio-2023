            <h1> A proposed alternative way of music discovery experience for SoundCloud through leveraging the social aspect.</h1>

                    <h3>OVERVIEW</h3>
                    <p>As a audio-streaming and sharing platform, SoundCloud allows users to be both listeners and creators, fostering the diverse creation of niche genres and music that is original to SoundCloud. Despite cultivating such a diverse large selection of music, SoundCloud’s songs recommendation often falls under HipHop and Rap, which limits exposure for other genres. We saw this as a missed opportunity to appeal to its own niche audience. <a class="text-link" href="#solution">Jump to solution.</a>
                    </p>
                    <p>Therefore for our 6-weeks senior experience design project at SFU, through extensive case studies and ideation, we proposed an additional way of discovery on top of what SoundCloud is currently doing by leveraging the social aspect that is unique to the brand.</p>

                    <p>To ground our project so it caters specifically to our client, we identified SoundCloud’s Brand Pillars that helps to align our designs to their values. 
                    </p>

                    <h4>The Social Aspect</h4>
                    
                    <p>During the field research of music industry, we noticed that only SoundCloud is offering a wide range of social aspect from commenting on specific timestamp in the music, reposting musics, and direct message which allows discussion to happen in platform.</p>

                    <h4>Hidden Gems</h4>
                    <p>With everyone having the equal and easy access to upload their music to SoundCloud, the platform became a place to discover new and pioneering music from all genres. With the current system and algorithm, SoundCloud is creating friction by burying the niche genres under bigger tracks, making hidden gems literally hidden.</p>

                 <h3>Framing Question</h3>
                 <p>How might we <em>increase the likelihood </em>for hidden gems to be discovered?</p>
             </div>

             <div class="col-6-right">
                <h3>RESEARCH</h3>
                <p>Through our initial research, we found out that since SoundCloud’s peak of 150 million registered users in 2015, they have lost 49% of their users by 2020. This was caused by the imbalance of what the users are interested in listening and engaging to, which consists more of niche music genres, and what the platform had been continuously surfacing which falls under Hip-Hop and Rap from well known musicians.
                </p>

                <p class="quotes">SoundCloud has struggled with the relevance and precision of their recommendations and many have departed from the platform due to this kind of ‘musical Russian roulette’.</p>
                <p class="quotes-source">– Jennie Silber, Music Recommendation Algorithms: Discovering Weekly or Discovering Weakly?</p>

                <p>Through 8 of our user interviews with current SoundCloud users and artist, we narrowed down our target audience into SoundCloud listeners who aren’t there in the platform for bigger music genres, but wanted to explore more smaller tracks and genre. We also identified common listening behaviours for music enthusiasts through secondary research. In which we concluded into three major behaviours.
