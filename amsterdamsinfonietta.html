                    <h3>OVERVIEW</h3>
                    <p>A 5-week visual design project for our senior experience design class, with the end goal of creating a visual identity that translates into an expressive microsite for our assigned client, Dutch string orchestra Amsterdam Sinfonietta. This was achieved through extensive study of our precedent graphic designers to help to ground our process and experimentations.
                    </p>
                    <p>A new Bosch Requiem had been performed annually since 2016, to commemorate the legacy of the passing Dutch painter, Hieronymus Bosch. We created an expressive microsite dedicated as a pre-purchase medium for their 2022 concert, performed by Amsterdam Sinfonietta. </p>

                    <h3>WOLFGANG WEINGART</h3>
                    <p>As the founding father of Swiss Punk, Weingart began to oppose the rigidness of Swiss Designs that follows strict design principles such as typography, grid, and symmetry. Through physical experimentations with text scale, weight and usage of the negative space, Weingart's intention is to challenge the type legibility that are often emphasized in Swiss Designs. Despite that, he still insists that typography should still be grounded, structured, and organized. This is what guides us through our experimentation.

                    <hr class="line-break margin-top">
                    <p>Weingart creates a sense of movement by rotating and cropping typographic elements, resulting in a composition that feels more dynamic while also challenging the readability of text.</p>

                <h3>RESEARCH</h3>
                <p>Through our initial research, we found out that since SoundCloud’s peak of 150 million registered users in 2015, they have lost 49% of their users by 2020. This was caused by the imbalance of what the users are interested in listening and engaging to, which consists more of niche music genres, and what the platform had been continuously surfacing which falls under Hip-Hop and Rap from well known musicians.
                </p>

                <p class="quotes">SoundCloud has struggled with the relevance and precision of their recommendations and many have departed from the platform due to this kind of ‘musical Russian roulette’.</p>
                <p class="quotes-source">– Jennie Silber, Music Recommendation Algorithms: Discovering Weekly or Discovering Weakly?</p>

                <p>Through 8 of our user interviews with current SoundCloud users and artist, we narrowed down our target audience into SoundCloud listeners who aren’t there in the platform for bigger music genres, but wanted to explore more smaller tracks and genre. We also identified common listening behaviours for music enthusiasts through secondary research. In which we concluded into three major behaviours.
